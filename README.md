# ChatGPT-NPC

ChatGPT-NPC is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the creation of intelligent and immersive non-player characters (NPCs) for role-playing games (RPGs). By leveraging the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT API and Eleven Labs' realistic text-to-speech technology, this project enables developers to create highly interactive and engaging NPCs that enhance the overall gaming experience.

## Key Features

- **Role-based NPCs**: ChatGPT-NPC allows developers to assign specific roles to NPCs, which are faithfully adhered to by the ChatGPT model. This ensures consistent behavior and responses throughout the game, enhancing believability and immersion for players.

- **Realistic Conversations**: NPCs created with ChatGPT-NPC can engage in realistic conversations with players, providing information and conducting transactions based on player input. The current implementation demonstrates this capability through a gun dealer NPC set in a post-apocalyptic zombie world.

- **Extensibility**: Developers can easily customize and expand the capabilities of NPCs by defining specific keywords or actions within the game. For example, when a player purchases a gun from the NPC, the response generated by ChatGPT can include a keyword like "sold," triggering a corresponding animation, such as the NPC handing over the purchased item to the player.

- **Future Enhancements**: ChatGPT-NPC aims to enable NPCs to perform specific actions based on dedicated commands, allowing for more complex and meaningful interactions between players and NPCs, such as requesting assistance, gathering information, or engaging in quests.

- **Realistic Text-to-Speech**: The integration of Eleven Labs' realistic text-to-speech technology provides NPCs with natural-sounding voices, adding an extra layer of realism to the conversations and helping players become more invested in the game world.
